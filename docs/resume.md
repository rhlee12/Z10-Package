- **_B.A., Geology_**. University of Colorado Boulder, May 2012 (Magna Cum Laude)

### Employment  
**_Research Scientist_** - Battelle (2016-Present) 
- Leading the Terrestrial Instrument System Commissioning effort for the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) project. 
- Writing validation and testing code in the R programming language to access the NEON database and perform quality checks in a reproducible workflow. 
- Overseeing the work of NEON staff and field technicians in troubleshooting and fixing areas of failure located in commissioning. 
- Summarizing findings and recommendations in technical reports using R Markdown. 
- Conducting field work for the NEON project, including site reviews and vegetation, water, and soil sampling. 
- Lead scientist for four data products: 1) Wet deposition chemistry, 2) Stable isotopes in wet deposition, 3) Particulate mass sampling, and 4) Summary weather statistics.   

**_Temporary researcher_** - Institute of Arctic and Alpine Research (INSTAAR), University of Colorado Boulder (2018-Present) 
- Developing code to support the work of graduate researchers seeking to characterize organic matter in soils. 
- Porting the PARAFAC (parallel factor analysis) modeling technique from Matlab to R.

**_Graduate Teacher and Researcher_** - Colorado School of Mines Geochemistry Department (2013 - 2015) 
- Examined the effects trivalent manganese may have on natural water chemistry, with a focus on the interaction between trivalent manganese and natural organic matter (NOM).
- Colorimetric techniques coupled with modeling chemical reaction kinetics in Mathematica. 
- Additionally led an average of three sections of Introduction to General Chemistry Lab. 
- Awarded the Chemistry Department's Outstanding Graduate Teaching award in 2014, in part for developing extra credit exercises in environmental chemistry for my students. 

**_Head Brewer_** - Deep Draft Brewing Co. (2012-2015) 
- Led a two-year recipe development phase and designed the recipes and system used to produce 10 barrel (310 gallon) batches. 
- Conducted the initial system installation and brewing at the production taproom. 
- Instituted cleaning and sanitation protocols, managed yeast cultures (washing yeast, performing viability counts, etc.) 
- Oversaw the front-of-house operations, materials purchasing, and employee training.  

**_Scientific Researcher_** - The University of Tübingen, Germany (2012-2013) 
- Worked with cell cultures, synthesizing minerals, and reacting materials in high pressure and temperature autoclaves. 
- Examined the role biomass may have played in the formation of the mineral assemblages found in banded iron formations during diagenesis and metamorphism. 

**_Laboratory Technician/Student Researcher_** - INSTAAR (2010-2012) \begin{itemize}[nosep] 
- Performed field work collecting soil samples, laboratory work preparing samples. 
- Conducted research investigating the effects acid mine drainage has on dissolved organic matter (DOM). 
- Conducted honors thesis research into the presence and evolution of DOM in snow pack through the winter.
